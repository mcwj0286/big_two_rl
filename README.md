# Deep Reinforcement Learning Applications in Probability-Driven Scenarios
## Big Two Card Game AI Agent Comparison


A comprehensive research project implementing and evaluating four distinct AI methodologies for playing Big Two (Èã§Â§ßÂºü), focusing on **loss minimization in highly randomized scenarios** with incomplete information. This work demonstrates the evolution from traditional machine learning to cutting-edge transformer architectures in strategic decision-making environments.

## üéØ Research Objectives

This project addresses the fundamental challenge of **developing AI agents that can minimize losses in probability-driven scenarios** where decisions must be made with limited information and uncertain outcomes. Specifically, we aim to:

1. **Compare Algorithm Performance**: Systematic evaluation of traditional ML vs. deep RL approaches
2. **Loss Minimization Focus**: Optimize strategies specifically for risk mitigation rather than pure win maximization  
3. **Imperfect Information Handling**: Develop robust decision-making in environments with hidden information
4. **Generalization Potential**: Create approaches applicable to real-world scenarios like financial markets and risk management

### Implemented Algorithms
1. **Decision Tree** - Traditional rule-based approach using sklearn
2. **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** - Value-based deep reinforcement learning
3. **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** - State-of-the-art policy gradient method
4. **Decision Transformer** - Transformer architecture treating RL as sequence modeling

## üÉè Big Two Game Environment

**Big Two** serves as an ideal testbed for probability-driven decision-making research due to its unique characteristics:

### Game Complexity
- **State Space**: 412-dimensional representation capturing hand compositions, game history, and player positions
- **Action Space**: 1695 possible actions including all valid card combinations
- **Player Configuration**: 4-player competitive environment with rotating turn order
- **Game Duration**: Variable length games with average 60-80 turns per game

### Research Challenges
- **Imperfect Information**: Players must make decisions without knowledge of opponents' cards
- **Sparse Reward Structure**: Feedback only available at game completion, requiring effective credit assignment
- **Strategic Depth**: Balance between aggressive plays and conservative risk management
- **Probability Assessment**: Estimating opponent strategies and remaining card distributions
